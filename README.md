# Saucy Tango Food Order Form

## Codecademy Project

In this practice project, you will create a food order form for a restaurant.

The local mom-and-pop shop, Saucy Tango, has received a lot of love from the community recently. To keep up with demand, they’ve decided to open their restaurant for online orders. They’ve entrusted this task to you, a budding React developer.

Your goal is to create a functional form that allows customers to place their orders easily. Once the customer submits the form, the form will alert them about their order details. You will be provided with a menu and your task is to create a form that can take in customer details such as name, phone number, address, and order.

To complete this project, you will use your understanding of controlled React forms. You’ll be using the State Hook to manage the state of the form, and employ event handlers to update the state of the form as the customer fills in their details.

Let’s dive in and get started!
